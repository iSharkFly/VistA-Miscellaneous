Usage instructions:
===================
1. Create two measure sets, one for Performance Measures, and one for Quality
Measures. If you have ones already created for other clinics, you can use them.
It's okay for them to have filter lists, as these will be deleted by the
software when the measure set is being copied.
 
2. Attach these measure sets to an Outpatient Parameter in the fields: MODEL
PERFORMANCE MEASURE SET and MODEL QUALITY MEASURE SET.  NB: The purpose of
these fields is to generate the a measure set to use in the fields EP MU
MEASUREMENT SET and EP QUALITY MEASUREMENT SET, respectively. If you have these
filled out, the Model fields will have no effect. 
 
3. Run the option EP UPDATE MU MEASURES. This create new measure sets based on
the model measure sets and attach the appropriate filter lists.
 
Miscellaneous remarks: If a model set is replaced and the option to update is
reran, the behavior is not to delete the old created measure set but rather to
merge the contents of the new model set into the old created measure set. I am
not sure if this is the desirable behavior, but that is how it currently works.
