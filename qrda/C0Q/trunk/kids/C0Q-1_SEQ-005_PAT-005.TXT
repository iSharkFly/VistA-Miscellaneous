DESCRIPTION:
============
Written by Sam Habiel on 17 October 2012 and released through VISTA Forum.

FUNCTIONALITY:
==============
This build fixes various bugs in the Quality Measurements package 
discovered during testing.
 
 1. Empty lists are created in advance for Outpatients. Previously, they
were not created, even though an entry point existed (INITCLST). 
 
 2. The Vitals lookup code that calls CPRS code didn't include today. 
This was fixed by adding .999999 to today's date.
 
 3. File security (@ sign everywhere) didn't permit normal users to edit 
the file. Previous, I defeated the @ sign protection by setting DLAYGO. 
However, DLAYGO got killed by Fileman after each edit, which meant that 
you can only edit one entry at a time before heading back out and back in 
to edit another entry. After discussion with Fileman developers, the 
proper way to do this was to not to use DLAYGO but rather remove the @ 
signs for Read, Write, and Laygo in the Files Definitions.
 
 - File list where protections were changed.
 --> C0Q MEASUREMENT SET (1130580001.201)
 --> C0Q QUALITY MEASURE (1130580001.101)
 --> C0Q PARAMETER (1130580001.401)
 
 - Options which don't use DLAYGO anymore.
 --> EDIT SUPERUSERS [C0Q EDIT SUPERUSERS]
 --> EP EDIT PARMS [C0Q EDIT OUTPATIENT PARMS]
 --> INP EDIT PARMS [C0Q EDIT INP PARMS]
 --> MEASURE SET EDIT [C0Q EDIT MEASURE SET]
 --> MU MEASURE EDIT [C0Q EDIT MU MEASURE]
 --> QUALITY MEASURE EDIT [C0Q EDIT QUALITY MEASURE]
 
4. The Outpatient Quality Measurement Set which is specified in the 
Parameters was being completely ignored. This is fixed.
 
5. The variable C0QNALT was not being newed in C0QUPDT. It acts as a flag 
indicating the type of measure (Performance vs Quality Measure). Since it 
was left lying around, a Quality Measure was mistakenly interpreted as a 
performance measure, giving you a result of zero, since there is no 
data for this Quality Measure.
 
6. The option that executes the logic for Outpatients C0Q EP UPDATE MU 
MEASURES didn't display the time on the dates of the Visits being
processed correctly. This patch fixes this.
