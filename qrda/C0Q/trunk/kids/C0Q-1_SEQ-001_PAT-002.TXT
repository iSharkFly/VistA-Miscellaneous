the Inpatient Measures rely on exist. If not, the Lab ADPAC needs to 
create them. These labs are:

 If these don't exist by the same name as above, the installer will be 
asked to rematch them.
 
 Users can remain on the system while this patch is installed.

 The Pre-installation routine PRE^C0Q1P2 will delete existing Reminder 
Exchange entries with the same name.
