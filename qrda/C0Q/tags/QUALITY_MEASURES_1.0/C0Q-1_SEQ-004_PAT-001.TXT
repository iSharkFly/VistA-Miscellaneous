           ENHANCEMENT

Description:
===========
 
 Source, Copyright, & Licensing:
 ===============================
 This patch to WorldVistA 2.0 was produced by George Lilly on 14 June 2012
and released through VISTA Forum.
 
 Copyright: Build documentation and C0QMUERX routine (c) George Lilly
2012.
 
 License: Package C0Q has license of GPL 2.0.
 
 Functionality:
 ==============
DESCRIPTION:
Addition of ePrescribing MU measure and code to support it. 
 
Dependencies:
This build needs C0P*1*4 for the new WebService entry that gets MU 
data from New Crop. It's not a technical dependency; the code will 
function without it, but it won't perform ERx calculations.
This build requires the base C0Q 1.0 to be installed.
 
This build performs the following:
Routines:
1. Adds routine C0QMUERX for calculation of ePrescribing stats.
2. Mods routine C0QMU12 to call C0QMUERX for the ERX measure for 
Outpatients.
3. Mods routine C0QUPDT to handle the special case of ePrescribing stats.
Also, some checks and quits so that we won't crash if no patient lists
are associated with a measure (general bug fix).

                                'P' FOR Performance; 
                                'Q' FOR Quality; 
                                'E' FOR Electronic Prescribing Performance; 
              LAST EDITED:      MAY 30, 2012 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter a code P, Q or E 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field designates the measure type. It can
                                be P, Q or M.  
                                 
                                P is for Performance. Performance measures are
                                MU measures to measure how meaningfully used an
                                EMR is. An example of a performance measure is
                                whether allergies are documented in the EMR.
                                Performance measures reference a Patient List
                                created by this package.  
                                 
                                Q is for Quality Measures. Quality measures are
                                MU measures to assess how well the patients are
                                cared for. An example of a quality measure is 
                                whether Hemoglobin A1c Poor Control. Quality
                                measures reference Patient Lists in the
                                Reminders package.  
                                 
                                E is for Electronic Prescribing. This is a
                                Performance measure, except that it is handled
                                differently than the rest. Instead of the
                                numerators and denominators being lists of
                                patients as with all the other measurements,
                                they are a number of prescriptions. That's why
                                we have a special flag for it. It references a
                                Patient List created by this package. The
                                numerator and denominators are stored in
                                subfiles for each patient.  
 
              TECHNICAL DESCR:  As of version C0P*1.0*1, the software doesn't
                                use this field except to check for an
                                electronic prescribing type (code E).  
                                 
                                I anticipate using this field for other
                                purposes in the future.
 
DATA:
The entry MU EP ERX for processing ePrescribing stats in C0Q QUALITY

 3.  Select Installation Option:
 
     NOTE:  The following are OPTIONAL - (When prompted for the INSTALL
             NAME, enter C0Q*1.0*1):
 
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
 
 4.  Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
 
     **This is the step to start the installation of this KIDS patch:
 
     a.  Choose the Install Package(s) option to start the patch install
         and enter "C0Q*1.0*1" at the INSTALL NAME prompt.
     b.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
         Install? NO//'  answer NO
     c.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
         NO//'  answer NO
     d.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
         and Protocols? NO//'  answer NO
 
 The post installation routine POST^C0Q1P1 will perform the following
tasks:
1. Re-index C0P PARAMETERS file fields EP MU MEASUREMENT SET  
(1130580001.401,2) and EP QUALITY MEASUREMENT SET  (1130580001.401,2.1) 
to make the AMMS and AQMS indeces respectively.
 
 Post-installation instructions
 ==============================
1. If you don't have New Crop eRx installed, there won't be any effects.
The C0Q code will behave like before.
2. If you don't have C0P*1.0*4 installed, again, the C0Q code will behave 
as before the patch.
3. Once you install C0P*1.0*4 with this patch (C0Q*1.0*1), the code will 
loop through all Outpatients who have an ERx. The actual patients are 
determined via your outpatient parameters. If your parameters reference a
clinic location that already has patients with ERxs, you don't need to do
anything to make the code run. It will run automatically; and it's time 
consuming; before you run it though, make sure to do #4.
4. In order for you to see a print out of the eRx measures, you
need to add the Measure MU EP ERX to the Measure Set used in the EP MU
MEASUREMENT SET field in your Outpatient Parameters. You must do this 
before you run this for the first time.
