DESCRIPTION:
The C0Q Quality Reporting Package is a mumps-based addition to VistA for 
reporting Meaningful Use and Quality Measurements. The package supports 
both inpatient and outpatient reporting, and computes the Meaningful Use 
measures from patient records. For Quality Measurements, the reporting 
package relies on the VistA Reminders Patient Lists as the source for its 
reporting.
