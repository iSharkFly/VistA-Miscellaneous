<  ; - Create a KIDS build that calls the following:

<  ;  1. VWPSSXPD to call from top is the Environment Check for the 
< "BLD",7926,1,24,0)
<  ;     Build
< "BLD",7926,1,25,0)
<  ;  2. PRE^VWPSSXPD is the Pre-Init for the Destination System
< "BLD",7926,1,26,0)
<  ;  3. POST^VWPSSXPD is the Post-Init for the Destination System
< "BLD",7926,1,27,0)
<  ;  4. TRAN^VWPSSXPD is the Pre-Transport Routine for your originating 
< "BLD",7926,1,28,0)
< system drug data
< "BLD",7926,1,29,0)
<  ; - Generate the KIDS Build. The file will have all the Drug Data from
